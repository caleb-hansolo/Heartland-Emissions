### Overview
  Heartland Emissions is a website that analyzes, interprets, and visualizes a dataset tracking Nebraska's CO2 emissions over the past few decades. The purpose of this website is to provide accessible and easy-to-understand information about the status of our state's effort (or lack thereof) to reduce emissions.
